## üì≤ Installation & Setup

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository and open in Xcode

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joshuafitzerald/axxesscare.git
cd axxesscare
```

Open axxesscare.xcodeproj with Xcode

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Firebase Setup
Download GoogleService-Info.plist from the Firebase Console.
Add the file to your project in Xcode

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ OpenAI setup(optional)

Delete Info.plist.example 

Create a new file called Info.plist in your root folder (Same folder where AxxessHealthAppApp.swift is)

Set the key to OpenAI_API_KEY make sure the dictionary type is string. Then change the value to your OpenAI API key. you can do so at this link https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview

#### COMMON ERROR: 
How to Fix the "Multiple commands produce 'Info.plist'" Error:
1. Check Build Phases for Duplicate Info.plist Entries:
Go to your project settings:

Click on the healthapp project in the Xcode Navigator.
Select the healthapp target.
Go to Build Phases.
Check the "Copy Bundle Resources" section:

Ensure Info.plist is NOT listed here.
If it is, remove it

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Build & Run the App
